#### Latest Projects
- **Generative Art**: Searching for new patterns. The idea for the project was to create fractals that are so infinitely deep that every image created is unique and something never seen before. I run the program at night generating images searching for new patterns. If I find something interesting, I can explore deeper or increase the resolution.

- **Gantt Charts**: I like making custom Gantt Charts, I wrote the code to generate charts using a markdown language. Still a work in progress. Some examples:

These charts were to determine whether it was better to pursue one assignment at a time, or whether to do four at a time. It allows for a visualization of details that aren't visible without considering the visual aspect of scheduling.
