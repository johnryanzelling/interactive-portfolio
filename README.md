## Welcome to my GitHub profile
I use github to store, manage, track, and share coding projects, but at the moment all repositories are private. 

### About
- I’m currently working on becoming a licensed teacher  
- I have a long career background in engineering and technology  
- I’m currently obtaining an MA in Education and Teaching Mathematics  
- I’m working on educational projects and database tools for learning  
- I have started writing a Math Foundations book for elementary and high school Mathematics test preperation. The book is title Math Foundations and I currently use it for my own lessons but have no plans to publish yet (its unfinished).

#### Latest Projects
- **Generative Art**: Searching for new patterns. The idea for the project was to create fractals that are so infinitely deep that every image created is unique and something never seen before. I can generate images when I'm sleeping. If I find something interesting, I can explore deeper or increase the resolution. Every image can be recreated using the random seed value and the bounds of the viewport into the fractal.

- **Gantt Charts**: I like making custom Gantt Charts, I wrote the code to generate charts using a markdown language. Still a work in progress. These charts were to determine whether it was better to pursue one assignment at a time, or whether to do four at a time. It allows for a visualization of details that aren't visible without considering the visual aspect of scheduling. Some examples:

- **Curve Plots**: Program that generates list of coordinates for use in generating 3d plots of parameterized curves. So far it includes 20 curve definitions of famous curves, adding more requires only updating a list and adding the equatinon. The program allows for exporting a csv of length n, which is then used to generate 3d point clouds or solids using the generating coordinates.
