#### Latest Project
- **Generative Art**: Searching for new patterns. The idea for the project was to create fractals that are so infinitely deep that every image created is unique and something never seen before. I run the program at night generating images searching for new patterns. If I find something interesting, I can explore deeper or increase the resolution.
